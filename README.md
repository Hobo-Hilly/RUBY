to start an interactive shell. Type $ irb 






┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~]
└─$ sudo irb               		# dorps us into a shell
irb(main):001:0> var1 = "X-"		# set variable equal "X-"
=> "X-"
irb(main):002:0> var1 = "MEN"		# set variable equal
=> "MEN"
irb(main):003:0> var1="MEN"		# set variable equal
=> "MEN"
irb(main):004:0> puts var1		# prints "MEN" to the screen
